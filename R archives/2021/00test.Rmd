# General info

# An R post

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

 For images, we can tell `knitr` to store the resulted images in the static directory, like:
 
 
```{r A}
opts_knit$set(base.dir = '/home/teoten/Code/WebApps/Rwhitedwarf-blog/static/post/test/')
```
Here, the final folder *test* does not yet exists, but it'll be created.

Then running `knitr::knit("post.Rmd")` will render the md file to the corresponding path. We still need to fix how the path is included in md file by adding the relative path of the image after `static` folder
