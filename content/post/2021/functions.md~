# Background

This is the first post of R with White Dwarf and I decided to start this blog with a basic tutorial. There is already a lot of information in the web about getting started with R. With a simple google search you can easily find info on how to install it, how to use R studio or other text editor, learn about the basic functions and concepts, etc. Therefore, I decided to start with a topic that is also basic but slightly less common: Functions.

How to create a function is not an easy topic for non-programmers and non-mathematicians, Myself I have a background in ecology and when I started using R for my statistical analysis I was avoiding using functions at all cost, while most of my colleagues where avoiding R fully. Many people has the idea that, as a programming language, R is really difficult to use and it should be left for the initiated ones. They end up using user interface based-software which assumes not only that the user doesn't know about programming, but also about statistics. It limits the possibilities of what you can do with your data and as a result, it limits also what you can learn. 

In today's world, it is important to to have at least a basic understanding of programming. [DEVELOP MORE HERE]


# Understanding functions in R

Using R is not difficult and creating functions the same. Basically, when we use R we are using functions all the time. When you can to obtain the summation of values, or the mean or standard deviation, you are simply calling a function to do that. 



```r
values <- c(2, 3, 4, 5)
sum(values)
```

[1] 14

```r
mean(values)
```

[1] 3.5

```r
sd(values)
```

[1] 1.290994


[CALL MEAN AND THEN MAKE IT AS FUNC]
