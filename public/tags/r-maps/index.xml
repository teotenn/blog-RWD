      <description>Scope of this post When you prepare for a job interview one of the questions they always tell you to prepare is &amp;ldquo;What are you most proud of?&amp;rdquo;. Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve never been asked that question in a job interview but it kept me thinking. Some years ago I developed the R code for the creation of maps of infrastructure for a Political Sciences project, and I can say that this is one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of. However, it is also true what they say to developers, that nobody cares about how you did it. The final user only cared about what was done, while the research team about what are the possibilities.</description>
